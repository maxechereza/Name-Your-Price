### Objective

Your assignment is to implement an interactive pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

The design team at Nero Motion Ltd has provided you with designs for this interactive pricing component. Your challenge is to build out the component using TypeScript and React and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Tasks

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers (details provided below)

### Page view and pricing totals

Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / \$8 per month
- 50K pageviews / \$12 per month
- 100K pageviews / \$16 per month
- 500k pageviews / \$24 per month
- 1M pageviews / \$36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **TypeScript** best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
